//! Resolved paint command — what the backend consumes.
//!
//! After the [`super::ResolutionPipeline`] runs, every dimension of the paint
//! operation has been fully evaluated:
//!
//! - **Colour** is concrete: RGBA for composite backends, CMYK for CMYK
//!   backends, or per-channel tints for separation / DeviceN backends.
//! - **Overprint** is a finished plan: which channels participate, and (for
//!   OPM=1 DeviceCMYK sources) which zero components pass through to leave
//!   the target plate untouched.
//! - **Blend** is classified into "native — use this tiny-skia mode" or
//!   "simulated — the backend must run the compositing op manually".
//! - **Clip** is a concrete reference to the composed mask, or `None`.
//!
//! The backend never sees `LogicalColor` or raw `GraphicsState`. It receives a
//! [`ResolvedPaintCmd`] and translates it into a draw call.
