//! Separation plate renderer.
//!
//! Renders individual ink separation plates as grayscale images where
//! pixel intensity represents the tint percentage of that ink at each point.
//! Used in prepress workflows, ink coverage analysis, and ML pipelines
//! that process packaging/label PDFs.
//!
//! # ICCBased heuristic
//!
//! When a fill color space resolves to an `ICCBased` array, this renderer
//! does **not** parse the embedded ICC profile. Instead it inspects the
//! component count of the current fill/stroke color: a 4-component
//! `ICCBased` space is treated as CMYK (component order C, M, Y, K), a
//! 3-component space is treated as RGB (skipped — no separation routing),
//! and a 1-component space is treated as Gray (skipped). This matches
//! the convention used by Adobe Illustrator and InDesign when exporting
//! to PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-4 with CMYK working spaces. PDFs that rely on
//! lab-CMYK profile interpretation for separation routing are out of
//! scope for this renderer; they are rare in prepress workflows that
//! ship separated artwork.
//!
//! # Images
//!
//! Raster image XObjects (`Do` with `Subtype /Image`) are routed into
//! separation plates per ISO 32000-1 §8.9:
//!
//! - **DeviceCMYK** and **ICCBased N=4** images: per-pixel C / M / Y / K
//!   samples route to the Cyan / Magenta / Yellow / Black plates. JPEG-
//!   encoded streams decode through
//!   `crate::extractors::images::decode_cmyk_jpeg_to_raw_cmyk` which
//!   preserves the Adobe APP14 inversion semantics so plate values are
//!   physical ink coverage (0 = no ink, 255 = full).
//! - **Separation /\<spot-ink\>**: the single sample channel routes to
//!   the named spot plate.
//! - **DeviceN [\<ink1\> \<ink2\> …]**: each sample channel routes to its
//!   named plate; the `tintTransform` function is not consulted —
//!   samples go directly to plates, which is the standard prepress
//!   per-plate routing convention.
//! - **Image masks** (`/ImageMask true`): the 1-bpc samples are a
//!   stencil through which the current non-stroking colour is painted.
//!   Per-plate routing uses the same `tint_for_ink` decision tree as
//!   vector fills, so `/All`, `/None`, and spot/process semantics match
//!   the rest of the renderer.
//! - **DeviceRGB / DeviceGray / ICCBased N∈{1,3}** images: skipped.
//!   RGB/Gray have no declared ink-coverage intent in the subtractive
//!   output model, so they neither paint nor knock out plates. Matches
//!   `tint_for_ink`'s vector handling.
//! - **JPX (JPEG 2000) image XObjects**: logged and skipped. No pure-
//!   Rust JP2 decoder is bundled.
//! - **Indexed images** (`[/Indexed …]`): expanded to RGB upstream and
//!   therefore skipped by separation routing for now. Indexed CMYK
//!   palettes would need a separate `expand_indexed_to_cmyk` path.
//!
//! ICC profiles (per-image and document `/OutputIntents`) and TRC /
//! BG / UCR functions are **not** consulted when routing image samples
//! to plates; samples are written verbatim. The plate is an absolute
//! ink-coverage measurement independent of any colour-management
//! transform.
//!
//! Spot / DeviceN ink *declarations* in nested Form XObject `/Resources`
//! are surfaced as plates via
//! [`crate::document::PdfDocument::get_page_inks_deep`] even when the
//! form's local content stream doesn't paint them.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! The following classes of content are recognised by the operator
//! walker but not actually painted into the plate:
//!
//! - **Shading patterns** (`sh` operator) — gradients used as fills.
//! - **Tiling and shading patterns** invoked via `scn` / `SCN` with a
//!   `/Pattern` colour space.
//! - **Inline images** (`BI` / `ID` / `EI`) — prepress artwork uses
//!   XObjects exclusively.
//! - **Page annotations.** [`render_separations`] renders only the
//!   page's content stream; annotation appearance streams are not
//!   walked, in contrast to [`super::page_renderer`] which composites
//!   annotation appearances on top of the page.
//!
//! These are intentional v1 omissions: the primary use case is
//! vector and image-based prepress artwork (dielines, varnish layers,
//! spot-PMS text and shapes, CMYK photographs, spot-ink-tinted images).
//!
//! # Transparency
//!
//! Plate output is opaque: the renderer treats `fill_alpha` / `stroke_alpha`
//! from ExtGState (`/CA`, `/ca`) and the blend mode (`/BM`) as if both were
//! `1.0` / `Normal`. This is intentional — a separation plate represents ink
//! coverage on the press, not transparent compositing. Callers who need the
//! transparent intent (e.g. a 50%-alpha spot text overlay) should evaluate it
//! against the underlying content with [`super::page_renderer`] first.
//!
//! # Overprint
//!
//! The renderer implements the per-plate overprint model defined in
//! ISO 32000-1 §11.7.4 ("Overprint Control"). The ExtGState entries
//! `/OP` (stroke), `/op` (non-stroke), and `/OPM` (overprint mode) are
//! parsed and applied to the graphics state.
//!
//! - **Default (`OP = false`):** for every plate, the spec rule "areas
//!   of unspecified colorants are erased (painted with a tint value of
//!   0.0)" applies. A DeviceCMYK fill knocks out underlying Cyan,
//!   Magenta, Yellow, Black, *and* any spot inks within its shape; a
//!   Separation `/Pantone-185` fill knocks out underlying process and
//!   other-spot plates within its shape. This is the standard
//!   per-plate prepress convention.
//! - **`OP = true`:** plates outside the source's colorant set are left
//!   untouched. Designers use this to overlay spot inks on process
//!   backgrounds without knocking them out (the typical packaging /
//!   label authoring workflow).
//! - **`OPM = 1` (Adobe nonzero overprint):** when the source colour
//!   space is DeviceCMYK and overprint is enabled, a component value of
//!   exactly `0.0` is treated as "colorant not specified" — the
//!   matching plate is left untouched. Per §11.7.4.3, OPM applies only
//!   to DeviceCMYK sources; Separation and DeviceN content is
//!   unaffected by OPM and routes through OP/op alone.
//!
//! Overprint state participates in `q`/`Q` save/restore via the existing
//! graphics-state stack and propagates into Form XObjects per §8.10.1.
//! The decision happens in `tint_for_ink`, which returns either
//! `PaintAction::Paint(tint)` (write tint into the plate; 0.0 = knockout)
//! or `PaintAction::Skip` (leave the plate untouched). Spot/DeviceN
//! sources route to their named plates regardless of overprint, matching
//! the inherent behavior of real separation devices.
