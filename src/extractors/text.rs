///
/// # Rules (in priority order)
///
/// **Rule 0**: Check if boundary space already exists (from trailing/leading whitespace)
/// - If preceding text ends with space OR following text starts with space, don't insert
/// - Confidence: 1.0 (deterministic)
///
/// **Rule 1**: TJ offset triggered flag
/// - If the TJ processor set the flag due to negative offset > threshold, insert space
/// - This is explicit PDF positioning information
/// - Confidence: 0.95 (highest, explicit signal)
///
/// **Rule 2**: Dual threshold (PDFBox pattern) with document-type adjustment
/// - Calculate both space-width-based and char-width-based thresholds
/// - Adjust thresholds based on document type (Academic/Policy/Mixed)
/// - Use MINIMUM of the two for robustness
/// - If gap exceeds this threshold, insert space
/// - Confidence: 0.8 (geometric measurement)
///
/// **Rule 3**: Character heuristic (CamelCase, number->letter, etc.)
/// - Detect character transitions indicating word boundaries
/// - If heuristic fires, insert space
/// - Confidence: 0.6 (pattern-based)
///
/// **Rule 4**: Conservative threshold (document-type aware)
/// - If gap exceeds conservative threshold (very small), insert space
/// - Catches small intentional gaps that are still word boundaries
/// - Adaptive to document type (Policy uses lower threshold, Academic uses higher)
/// - Confidence: 0.5 (conservative)
///
/// **Default**: No space inserted
///
/// # Document Type Adjustment
///
/// When document_type is provided, thresholds are adjusted:
/// - **Academic** (1.4x multiplier): Higher thresholds for loose spacing
/// - **Policy** (0.6x multiplier): Lower thresholds for tight justified text
/// - **Mixed** (1.0x multiplier): Default/balanced approach
///
/// This matches research findings from LA-PDFText, pdfminer.six, PDFBox, and iText
/// that adaptive thresholds provide better results than fixed values.

/// "The identification of what constitutes a word is unrelated to how the text
/// happens to be grouped into show strings... text strings should be as long as possible."
/// Recover an honest inter-glyph gap for the space-insertion decision.
///
/// Per ISO 32000-1:2008 §9.4.4, the spacing between two glyphs is the
/// text-space displacement between their origins; a word space exists when
/// that displacement reaches the font's space advance. We measure it from
/// the bounding boxes (`raw_gap = next.x − prev.right_edge`).
///
/// When the previous span's font has no explicit `/Widths` array,
/// `FontInfo` substitutes a fixed fallback advance (~0.55 em) that
/// systematically OVER-reports proportional Latin glyphs. That inflates
/// `bbox.width`, pushing `prev.right_edge` past the real glyph end so it can
/// swallow a true word gap and drive `raw_gap` NEGATIVE — glyphs that do not
/// actually overlap appear to. Only in that overlap case do we
/// divide out the fallback inflation (0.55 em ÷ 0.45 em ≈ 1.22) to restore a
/// believable gap.
///
/// Crucially, the correction is applied ONLY when `raw_gap < 0`. When the
/// glyphs do not overlap (`raw_gap ≥ 0`) the layout is already honest
/// must not be second-guessed: inflating a non-overlapping gap manufactures
/// a phantom word space and splits single words that were positioned
/// edge-to-edge — e.g. a CamelCase brand "SalesForce" emitted as
/// "SalesF" + "orce" with `raw_gap == 0` would otherwise be torn into
/// "SalesF orce". (`bbox.width × (1 − 1/1.22)` is the algebraic form of
